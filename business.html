<p>I often find myself learning about some business ideas that I wish I have had myself. Since I work with software development, these ideas I like are usually related on that field. Here are some:</p>
<p>CD Baby - created by Derek Sivers but later sold</p>
<p>Wordpress and Automattic - one of the finest ways to create open source software in a sustenable way.</p>
<p>Shopify - not only a great idea that starting by straight ones own itch, but also great execution to a leading player.</p>
